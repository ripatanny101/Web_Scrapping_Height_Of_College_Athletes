# Web_Scrapping_Height_Of_College_Athletes

The objective of this analysis is to determine whether collegiate swimmers or volleyball players are taller on average. This exploration arises from a marketing company's interest in understanding heights among players in different sports.

Leveraging web scraping and data analysis, height data was methodically extracted from 40 different rosters of several colleges and universities across the country. The focus remained steadfast on both men's and women's swimming and volleyball teams, culminating in a comprehensive comparison of their average heights. We will also find the names and the heights of the athletes with the 5 tallest and 5 shortest heights for both the men’s and women’s teams and generate a bar graph showing the average height distribution across the 4 different team categories.
